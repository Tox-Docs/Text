Crypto core contains all the crypto related functions used by toxcore that
relate to random numbers, encryption and decryption, key generation, nonces
and random nonces. Not all crypto library functions are wrapped, only those
that needed to be are. For example the NaCl functions that require a zero byte
buffer before the data. You'll see functions that are provided by the crypto
library used in the toxcore code, not just crypto_core functions.

The create and handle request functions are the encrypt and decrypt functions
for a type of DHT packets used to send data directly to other DHT peers. To be
honest they should probably be in the DHT module but they seem to fit better
here.

The goal of this module is to provide nice interfaces to some crypto related
functions.
