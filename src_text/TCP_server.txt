The TCP server in tox has the goal of acting like a TCP relay between clients
who cannot connect directly to each other or who for some reason are limited
to using the TCP protocol to connect to each other. TCP_server is typically
run only on actual server machines but any Tox client could host one as the
api to run one is exposed through the tox.h api.

To connect to a hosted TCP server toxcore uses the TCP client module.

The TCP server implementation in toxcore can currently either work on epoll on
linux or using unoptimized but portable socket polling.

TCP connections between the TCP client and the server are encrypted to prevent
an outsider from knowing information like who is connecting to who just be
looking at someones connection to a TCP server. This is useful when someone
connects though something like Tor for example. It also prevents someone from
injecting data in the stream and makes it so we can assume that any data
received was not tampered with and is exactly what was sent by the client.

When a client first connects to a TCP server he opens up a TCP connection to
the ip and port the TCP server is listening on. Once the connection is
established he then sends a handshake packet, the server then responds with
his own and a secure connection is established. The connection is then said to
be unconfirmed and the client must then send some encrypted data to the server
before the server can mark the connection as confirmed. The reason it works
like this is to prevent a type of attack where a peer would send a handshake
packet and then time out right away.To prevent this the server must wait for a
sign that the client received his handshake packet before confirming the
connection. The both can then communicate with each other using n encrypted
connection.

The TCP server essentially acts as just a relay between 2 peers. When a TCP
client connects to the server he tells the server which clients he wants the
server to connect him to. The server will only let two clients connect to each
other if both have indicated to the server that they want to connect to each
other. This is to prevent non friends from checking if someone is connected to
a TCP server. The TCP server supports sending packets blindly through it to
clients with a client with public key X (OOB packets) however the TCP server
does not give any feedback or anything to say if the packet arrived or not and
as such it is only useful to send data to friends who may not know that we are
connected to the current TCP server while we know they are.

In order to make toxcore work on TCP only the TCP server supports relaying
onion packets from TCP clients and sending any responses from them to TCP
clients.

To establish a secure connection with a TCP server send the following 128
bytes of data to the server:

[public key of client (32 bytes)][nonce for the encrypted data [24 bytes]][encrypted with the private key of the client and public key of the server and the nonce:[public key (32 bytes) and][base nonce we want the server to use to encrypt the packets sent to us (24 bytes)]]


The first 32 bytes are the public key that we are announcing ourselves to the
server to. The next 24 bytes are a nonce which we use along with the secret
key associated with the public key in the first 32 bytes of the packet to
encrypt the rest of this 'packet'. The encrypted part of this packet contains
a temporary public key that will be used for encryption during the connection
and will be discarded after. It also contains a base nonce.

If the server decrypts successfully the encrypted data in the handshake packet
and responds with the following of length 96 bytes:

[nonce for the encrypted data [24 bytes]][encrypted with the public key of the client and private key of the server and the nonce:[public key (32 bytes) and][base nonce we want the client to use to encrypt the packets sent to us (24 bytes)]]

The client already knows the long term public key of the server so it is
omitted in the response, instead only a nonce is present in the unencrypted
part. The encrypted part of the response has the same elements as the
encrypted part of the request: a temporary public key tied to this connection
and a base nonce both unique for the connection.

After this the client will know the connection temporary public key and base
nonce of the server and the server will know the connection base nonce and
temporary public key of the client.

The client will then send an encrypted packet to the server, the contents of
the packet do not matter and it must be handled normally by the server (ex: if
it was a ping send a pong response), the only thing that does matter is that
the packet was encrypted correctly by the client because it means that the
client has correctly received the handshake response the server sent to it and
that the handshake the client sent to the server really came from the client
and not from an attacker replaying packets. The server must prevent resource
consuming attacks by timing out clients if they do not send any encrypted
packets so the server to prove to the server that the connection was
established correctly.

When the server confirms the connection he must look in the list of connected
peers to see if he is already connected to a client with the same announced
public key. If this is the case the server must kill the previous connection
because this means that the client previously timed out and is reconnecting.
Because of Toxcore design it will not happen that two legitimate different
peers will have the same public key so this is the correct behavior.


Encrypted packets look like this to outsiders:
[[uint16_t (length of data)][encrypted data]]

In a TCP stream they would look like:
[[uint16_t (length of data)][encrypted data]][[uint16_t (length of data)][encrypted data]][[uint16_t (length of data)][encrypted data]]...

Both the client and server use the following (temp public and private (client
and server) connection keys) which are each generated for the connection and
then sent to the other in the handshake and sent to the other. They are then
used like the next diagram shows to generate a shared key which is equal on
both sides.

Client:                                     Server:
generate_shared_key(                        generate_shared_key(
[temp connection public key of server],     [temp connection public key of client],
[temp connection private key of client])    [temp connection private key of server])
=                                           =
[shared key]                                [shared key]

The generated shared key is equal on both sides and is used to encrypt and
decrypt the encrypted data packets.

each encrypted data packet sent to the client will be encrypted with the
shared key and with a nonce equal to: (client base nonce + number of packets
sent so for the first packet it is (starting at 0) nonce + 0, the second is
nonce + 1 and so on. Note that nonces like all other numbers sent over the
network in toxcore are numbers in big endian format so when increasing them by
1 the least significant byte is the last one)

each packet received from the client will be decrypted with the shared key and
with a nonce equal to: (server base nonce + number of packets sent so for the
first packet it is (starting at 0) nonce + 0, the second is nonce + 1 and so
on. Note that nonces like all other numbers sent over the network in toxcore
are numbers in big endian format so when increasing them by 1 the least
significant byte is the last one)

Encrypted packets have a hard maximum size of 2048 in the toxcore TCP server
implementation, 2048 is big enough to make sure that all toxcore packets can
go through and leaves some extra space just in case.


The logic behind the format of the handshake is that we:
1. need to prove to the server that we own the private key related to the
   public key we are announcing ourselves with.
2. need to establish a secure connection that has perfect forward secrecy
3. prevent any replay, impersonation or other attacks

How it accomplishes each of those points:
1. If the client does not own the private key related to the public key they
   will not be able to create the handshake packet.
2. temporary session keys generated by the client and server in the encrypted
   part of the handshake packets are used to encrypt/decrypt packets during the
   session.
3. a. Attacker modifies any byte of the handshake packets: Decryption fail, no
      attacks possible
   b. Attacker captures the handshake packet from the client and replays it
      later to the server: Attacker will never get the server to confirm the
      connection (no effect)
   c. Attacker captures a server response and sends it to the client next time
      they try to connect to the server: Client will never confirm the
      connection. (See: TCP_client)
   d. Attacker tries to impersonate a server: They won't be able to decrypt
      the handshake and won't be able to respond.
   e. Attacker tries to impersonate a client: Server won't be able to decrypt
      the handshake.

The logic behind the format of the encrypted packets is that:
1. TCP is a stream protocol, we need packets.
2. Any attacks must be prevented

How it accomplishes each of those points:
1. 2 bytes before each packet of encrypted data denote the length. We assume a
   functioning TCP will deliver bytes in order which makes it work. If the TCP
   doesn't it most likely means it is under attack and for that see the next
   point.
2. a. Modifying the length bytes will either make the connection time out
      and/or decryption fail.
   b. Modifying any encrypted bytes will make decryption fail.
   c. Injecting any bytes will make decryption fail.
   d. Trying to re order the packets will make decryption fail because of the
      ordered nonce.
   c. Removing any packets from the stream will make decryption fail because
      of the ordered nonce.


The folowing represents the various types of data that can be sent inside
encrypted data packets.
//TODO: nice graphics

0 - Routing request.
[uint8_t id (0)][public key (32 bytes)]
1 - Routing request response.
[uint8_t id (1)][uint8_t (rpid) 0 (or invalid connection_id) if refused, connection_id if accepted][public key (32 bytes)]
2 - Connect notification:
[uint8_t id (2)][uint8_t (connection_id of connection that got connected)]
3 - Disconnect notification:
[uint8_t id (3)][uint8_t (connection_id of connection that got disconnected)]
4 - ping packet
[uint8_t id (4)][uint64_t ping_id (0 is invalid)]
5 - ping response (pong)
[uint8_t id (5)][uint64_t ping_id (0 is invalid)]
6 - OOB send
[uint8_t id (6)][destination public key (32 bytes)][data]
7 - OOB recv
[uint8_t id (7)][senders public key (32 bytes)][data]
8 - onion packet (same format as initial onion packet) but packet id is 8 instead of 128)
9 - onion packet response (same format as onion packet with id 142 but id is 9 instead.)
16 and up - Data
[uint8_t connection_id][data]

The TCP server is set up in a way to minimize waste while relaying the many
packets that might go between two tox peers hence clients must create
connections to other clients on the relay. The connection number is a uint8_t
and must be equal or greater to 16 in order to be valid. Because a uint8_t has
a maximum value of 256 it means that the maximum number of different
connections to other clients that each connection can have is 240. The reason
valid connection_ids are bigger than 16 is because they are the first byte of
data packets. Currently only number 0 to 9 are taken however we keep a few
extras in case we need to extend the protocol without breaking it completely.

Routing request (Sent by client to server):
Send a routing request to the server that we want to connect to peer with
public key where the public key is the public the peer announced themselves
as. The server must respond to this with a Routing response.

Routing response (Sent by server to client):
The response to the routing request, tell the client if the routing request
succeeded (valid connection_id) and if it did, tell them the id of the
connection (connection_id). The public key sent in the routing request is also
sent in the response so that the client can send many requests at the same
time to the server without having code to track which response belongs to
which public key.

The only reason a routing request should fail is if the connection has reached
the maximum number of simultaneous connections.

Connect notification (Sent by server to client):
Tell the client that connection_id is now connected meaning the other is
online and data can be sent using this connection_id.

Disconnect notification (Sent by client to server):
Sent when client wants the server to forget about the connection related to
the connection_id in the notification. Server must remove this connection and
must be able to reuse the connection_id for another connection. If the
connection was connected the server must send a disconnect notification to the
other client. The other client must think that this client has simply
disconnected from the TCP server.

Disconnect notification (Sent by server to client):
Sent by the server to the client to tell them that the connection with
connection_id that was connected is now disconnect. It is sent either when the
other client of the connection disconnect or when they tell the server to kill
the connection (see above).

Ping and Pong packets (can be sent by both client and server, both will respond):
ping packets are used to know if the other side of the connection is still
live. TCP when established doesn't have any sane timeouts (1 week isn't sane)
so we are obliged to have our own way to check if the other side is still
live. Ping ids can be anything except 0, this is because of how toxcore sets
the variable storing the ping_id that was sent to 0 when it receives a pong
response which means 0 is invalid.

The server should send ping packets every X seconds (toxcore TCP_server sends
them every 30 seconds and times out the peer if it doesn't get a response in
10). The server should respond immediately to ping packets with pong packets.

The server should respond to ping packets with pong packets with the same
ping_id as was in the ping packet. The server should check that each pong
packet contains the same ping_id as was in the ping, if not the pong packet
must be ignored.

OOB send (Sent by client to server):
If a peer with private key equal to the key they announced themselves with is
connected, the data in the OOB send packet will be sent to that peer as an OOB
recv packet. If no such peer is connected, the packet is discarded. The
toxcore TCP_server implementation has a hard maximum OOB data length of 1024.

OOB recv (Sent by server to client):
OOB recv are sent with the announced public key of the peer that sent the OOB
send packet and the exact data.

Data:
Data packets can only be sent and received if the corresponding connection_id
is connection (a Connect notification has been received from it) if the server
receives a Data packet for a non connected or existent connection it will
discard it.

Why did I use different packet ids for all packets when some are only sent by
the client and some only by the server? It's less confusing.
